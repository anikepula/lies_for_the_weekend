# 1st Anniversary

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheeesycat69/daily_dose/main/august_9/sorry.jpeg)


This last year after you came into my life has been so eventful, exhilerating and at the same time filled with joy and love I thought I would never experiance.
Getting to see you everytime on a video call or in real life activates all the reward centers in my brain and lights up the muscles on my face involutarily to smile.
Every moment spent with you feels like a celebration of existence itself.

When we are old, I want to cherish all the special moments we have enjoyed and experienced. 
This blog is going to be the secret keeper of all the crazy things we will do together.
A digital diary that we will open time and time again to reminisce the good times and look forward to better ones.

I peenkan promise you that we will fill this digial diary up with unforgettable memories and savor it every time we go through this.

You're my wish that came true. You're the first thing I think of every morning after I wake up and last thing I think of everynight before I sleep off.
If I had to do this all over again, I would as many times as I could.
To our time together on earth and beyond.
Love you shreshkiii <3.
